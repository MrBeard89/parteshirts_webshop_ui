Hello

My name is Norbert Kovacs

I wanted to have a webshop UI that has all the features. For the design it is very vivid and extravagant because the products it self are targeted young people.The Webshop at the beginning it was going to be live, but with collaboration with my sibling we changed our mind.

MERN Stack:
Fetching data from MongoDB with Axios and using NodeJs server with ExpressJs
